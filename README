    -> add a new method in 'app/views.py' delete_task which takes request and a parameter along it which is a string then matches that string into the stored task list
            then deletes the task that matches the string.
    -> made a route for the above function in urls.py.
    -> used a simple emoji with anchor tag to trigger the url for deletion along the task.

    -> !!!using persistent cookies to store tasks with a default date of 7 days..
    -> made the ui for the todo app
    -> made a form for submitting the task that needs to be added to the list and using (DTL) viewing the list.
    -> a function in the 'app/views.py' names 'add_task' updates the list of task whenever the submit button is clicked as the function is linked to it.
    -> added css so the form looks nice..
